# Cryptocurrency AI Chatbot

We are developing and deploying a cryptocurrency AI chatbot using Gaia nodes and Flowise low-code tools to provide powerful real-time cryptocurrency information queries and forecasting capabilities. The chatbot will offer users the ability to access current cryptocurrency prices, market information, and predictive analysis of future trends.

## Development Overview

### Tools and Technologies

- **Gaia Node**: Gaia nodes act as decentralized blockchain nodes capable of securely handling and processing data. We will use it as the backend system foundation to retrieve and process real-time cryptocurrency market data.
- **Flowise Low-Code Development Platform**: Flowise is a powerful low-code development tool that allows us to build and connect AI models and corresponding functional modules using a simple drag-and-drop interface. With Flowise, we can quickly create conversation flows and user interaction interfaces, making the chatbot smarter.
- **API Integration**: By integrating multiple cryptocurrency data source APIs, such as CoinGecko or Binance API, the bot will fetch real-time market prices and relevant data.

### Features

- **Real-Time Price Query**: Users can query the real-time prices of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., via the chatbot.
- **Market Information Updates**: The bot will provide cryptocurrency market news, significant events, and their potential impact on the market.
- **Trend Prediction**: Leveraging AI models and historical data analysis, the bot will offer users market trend predictions, helping them make more informed investment decisions.
- **Multilingual Support**: The chatbot will support multiple languages to cater to a global user base.
- **Scalability**: The system architecture supports scalability, allowing the future integration of more cryptocurrencies and additional functional modules.
